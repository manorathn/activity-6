        <p>Arguably one of the most famous strange-looking animals on this list is the axolotl. Also known as the Mexican walking fish, this cute salamander isn’t a fish, at all. It is an amphibian that doesn’t actually develop lungs. Instead, it has gills and stays, for the most part, in the water. Due to its ever-youthfulness, it makes sense that the axolotl would appear to always have a smile on its face. Despite being able to regenerate limbs, it is still an endangered species.</p>
